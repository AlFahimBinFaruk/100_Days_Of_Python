### Python Math
* Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

### Built-in Math Functions
* The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
```bash
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y) 
```

* The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
```bash
x = abs(-7.25)
print(x) 
```

* The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (x^y).
```bash
x = pow(4, 3)
print(x) 
```

### The Math Module
* Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
* When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.
```bash
import math
# Ex 01 : The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:
x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x) 

# Ex 02 : The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:
x = math.ceil(1.4)
y = math.floor(1.4)

print(x) # returns 2
print(y) # returns 1


# Ex 03 : The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):
x = math.pi
print(x)
```
